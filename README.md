# Mamba-QuickTutor
 
QuickTutor is essentially an Uber for Tutors. The app connects college students with tutors near them. We believe that on-demand tutoring from our peers would be a huge help in our overall success. 

If a user would like to act as a tutor, they can go to the 'Feed' tab where all incomplete requests are displayed. As a tutee, they can go to the 'Request' tab where they can specify their location, what they need help on, and add an estimated fee. Users can view each other's profiles before offering help or accepting an offer for help. The profiles will display their profile picture, email, description, and reviews/ratings. This info can be updated under the 'My Profile' option in the navigation bar dropdown. Once a tutee has accepted a tutor's offer, the tutor will receive an email notification. Tutors and tutees can communicate with each other through the messaging feature. If you'd like to message a user that you have not actually worked with before, you can simply add them by their email address. Users that have worked with each other will also have the option of rating one another.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the guidance and support of many people, so we'd like to thank Professor Sherriff, Catherine Bradberry, and the rest of the amazing TA staff!
