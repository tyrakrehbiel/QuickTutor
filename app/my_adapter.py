        Invoked just after a user successfully authenticates via a
        social provider, but before the login is actually processed
        (and before the pre_social_login signal is emitted).

        - social account already exists, just go on
        - social account has no email or email is unknown, just go on
        - social account's email exists, link social account to existing user

        # with mobile numbers only, but allauth takes care of this case so just
        # ignore it
        if 'email' not in sociallogin.account.extra_data:
            return

        # check if given email address already exists.
